Implementation of _Hamurabi_ in [PureBasic], created by [Tristano Ajmone] in November 2020, released under the [MIT License].

# About PureBasic

[PureBasic] is commercial modern and cross platform BASIC programming language and IDE that can compile 32-bit and 64-bit binary applications to Windows, Linux and Mac operating systems.

There's also a [free version of PureBasic], which comes with some usage and features restrictions, but without time limitations.


# Building

Compile the [`hamurabi.pb`][hamurabi.pb] as a console application, either 32-bit or 64-bit.
In the PureBasic IDE, open the __Compiler Options__ panel and choose __Executable Format__ &gt; __Console__.

You should also be able to compile it using the [free version of PureBasic] since the source file is well below the 800 lines limit of the free version.

The program was developed under Windows, but it should also compile under Linux and Mac without any changes because it doesn't use any OS-specific features.
